# vim-setup

This is just a small directory to keep my custom vim stuff uniform across my workstations.
The cshtml.vim is from OrangeT and can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/OrangeT/vim-csharp/blob/master/syntax/cshtml.vim">here</a>.
The codedark.vim is a *slightly* different version of tomasiser's, which is located
<a href="https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark/blob/master/colors/codedark.vim">here</a>.
